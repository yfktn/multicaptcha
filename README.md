## Fork Of MultiCaptcha OctoberCMS Plugin

Hi, this is only my attempt to add permission to plugin that owned by [Vijay Wilson](https://octobercms.com/author/VijayWilson), the [MultiCaptcha](https://octobercms.com/plugin/vijaywilson-multicaptcha).

Since I can't figure out the original repo, then at here I create my own, based on his code. You can access it at the **user-permission** branch.

My code only try to add permission feature to this plugin, so it doesn't shown to all the user that login at backend of OctoberCms. For more documentation about how to use it, read the documentation of it in [the MultiCaptcha OctoberCMS Plugin Page](https://octobercms.com/plugin/vijaywilson-multicaptcha).
